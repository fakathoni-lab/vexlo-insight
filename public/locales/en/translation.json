    "a2": "No. Never. VEXLO uses only publicly observable ranking data. Zero credentials required from your prospect at any point.",
    "q3": "How is this different from Ahrefs or SEMrush?",
    "a3": "Ahrefs and SEMrush are post-sale research tools. VEXLO is a pre-sale closing weapon. Different job. Different moment. Different outcome.",
    "q4": "Is the data accurate enough to show a client?",
    "a4": "VEXLO uses the same public ranking signals agencies present in pitches daily. The disclaimer is built in: estimated public data for sales context — not certified analytics.",
    "q5": "Can I white-label the reports?",
    "a5": "Agency Pro and Elite plans include custom brand kit: your logo, brand colors, and domain. The report reads as your agency's, not VEXLO's.",
    "q6": "What is a Proof Score?",
    "a6": "A 0–100 composite score: ranking position (40%), 30-day trend (30%), AI Overview presence (20%), keyword coverage (10%). Green = strong proof. Red = urgent pain.",
    "q7": "What happens after founding slots are gone?",
    "a7": "Pricing increases to public tiers. Founding members keep their rate permanently, regardless of future pricing changes.",
    "q8": "When will VEXLO be live?",

    a1: "A branded, shareable document showing a prospect's current Google rankings, 30-day trend, Proof Score (0–100), AI Overview presence, and a 2-paragraph sales narrative — all generated from public data in under 60 seconds.",
    q2: "Do I need access to the prospect's Google Search Console?",
    a2: "No. Never. VEXLO uses only publicly observable ranking data. Zero credentials required from your prospect at any point.",
    q3: "How is this different from Ahrefs or SEMrush?",
    a3: "Ahrefs and SEMrush are post-sale research tools. VEXLO is a pre-sale closing weapon. Different job. Different moment. Different outcome.",
    q4: "Is the data accurate enough to show a client?",
    a4: "VEXLO uses the same public ranking signals agencies present in pitches daily. The disclaimer is built in: estimated public data for sales context — not certified analytics.",
    q5: "Can I white-label the reports?",
    a5: "Agency Pro and Elite plans include custom brand kit: your logo, brand colors, and domain. The report reads as your agency's, not VEXLO's.",
    q6: "What is a Proof Score?",
    a6: "A 0–100 composite score: ranking position (40%), 30-day trend (30%), AI Overview presence (20%), keyword coverage (10%). Green = strong proof. Red = urgent pain.",
    q7: "What happens after founding slots are gone?",
    a7: "Pricing increases to public tiers. Founding members keep their rate permanently, regardless of future pricing changes.",
    q8: "When will VEXLO be live?",
    a8: "Founding members get access first — before public launch. Expected Q2 2026. You'll receive a direct access link via email.",
